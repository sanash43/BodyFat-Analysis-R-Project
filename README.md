# BodyFat-Analysis-R-Project

**Motivation**
This project aims to identify an alternative method from BMI (Body Mass Index) to diagnose obesity while maintaining widespread accessibility. This project will first identify which body measurements have the strongest correlation to body fat percentage, pairing it with the least correlated variable. This will produce a ratio with a strong correlation to body fat percentage. The test statistic of interest is the abdomen circumference-to-height ratio. 

**Methods**
With bootstrapping, asymptotics, and confidence intervals, this project aim to use hypothesis testing and confidence intervals to determine a discrepancy between BMI classification and the abdomen circumference-to-height ratio.


**Exploration**: is there a difference between the mean abdomen circumference to height proportion between healthy and overweight men under BMI classification?

<u> Null hypothesis, $H_0$ </u>: there is no difference in the mean abdomen circumference to height proportion between men in the healthy and overweight BMI category.

<u>Alternative hypothesis, $H_A$ </u>: there is a difference in the mean abdomen circumference to height proportion between men in the healthy and overweight BMI category.
